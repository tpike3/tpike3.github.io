## Leader and Complex Systems Scientist


<h2 style="text-align: left"> Research Interests </h2>

<p>

I have four broad research areas that fall under the umbrella of next generation governance and decisions making

</p>

        <div class="summary-caption">Simulation Accessibility</div>
        <div class="summary-text">
            I am interested in how to create a simulation ecosystem that allows users to rapidly create and customize valid simulations to aid their decision-making. Whether a family planning a day trip, a manager trying to determine the impact of resource allocations, or world leaders debating effective international governance. <br><br>
            I think the integration of GPTs that can generate agent behavior with multi-agent reinforcement learning with human feedback learning can make this once insurmountable task highly feasible.

<div class="image-summary-container">
    <img src="images/metabolism.jpg" alt="Financial Metabolism">
        <div class="summary-content">
        <div class="summary-caption">Financial Metabolism</div>
        <div class="summary-text">
            I am interested in how societies metabolize finance and the impact of that processing impacts their socio-culture-political economy and impacts their emergent behavior as a population. <br><br>
            This approach thinks of money as an energy stream following through groups allowing or restricting their options which then has impact over time on how that population functions. Although this focuses on finance, societies are non-decomposable and culture and information streams shape how people view their energy stream (e.g. outrage or acceptance)

<div class="image-summary-container">
    <img src="images/transition.jpg" alt="Societal Phase Transitions">
        <div class="summary-content">
        <div class="summary-caption">Societal Phase Transitions</div>
        <div class="summary-text">
            Complex systems demonstrate indicators when they are about to transition from one state to another. These indicators are seen in humans transition from a depressive to non-depressive state, ecologies transitioning from one state to another such as a forest to a savannah.<br><br>
            What are the signatures of human society as its  stability (its homeorhesis) starts to weaken as it transitions from one state to another, such as an autocracy to a democracy?

<div class="image-summary-container">
    <img src="images/opensource.jpg" alt="Open Source Dynamics">
        <div class="summary-content">
        <div class="summary-caption">Open Source Dynamics</div>
        <div class="summary-text">
            Open Source Software has proven to be an an incredible decentralized problems solving network, enabled by the internet and coding repositories. Understanding more effectively how these dynamics works can prove incredibly insightful into  understanding optimal organization and problem solving dynamics to aid organizational and societal governance.
