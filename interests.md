I have four broad research areas tha fall under the umbrella of next generation governance and decisions making

            I am interested in how to create a simulation ecosystem that allows users to rapidly create and customize valid simulations to aid their decision-making. Whether a family planning a day trip, a manager trying to determine the impact of resource allocations, or world leaders debating effective international governance. <br><br>
            I think the integration of GPTs that can generate agent behavior with multi-agent reinforcement learning with human feedback learning can make this once insurmountable task highly feasible.
