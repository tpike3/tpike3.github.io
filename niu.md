        <p> From August 2019 to November 2021 I served as faculty member in the Cyber Intelligence and Data Science Department co-building the data science curriculum </p>
            <ul>
                <li> Created half of NIUâ€™s data science curriculum resulting in a program that is accessible to beginners as well as experienced data scientists, dramatically increasing technical literacy. The data science program quickly became the most technical curriculum at NIU. The curriculum educates students to effectively apply data science techniques (e.g. Statistics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Simulation) in practical effective ways to address the hard problems of national security. </li>
                <br>
                <li> Developed and executed a curriculum to holistically at look the dynamics of U.S. security through the rapidly evolving financial technology landscape, the dynamics of global supply chain, and the impact of finance and governance on emergent socio-cultural-political-economic societal behavior.
